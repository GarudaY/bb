That... that is not what you wanted to see. %They_wildman% sizes up the beehive, tongue out, eyes slimmed. You rush forward, yelling at %them_wildman%, but %they_wildman%\'s already honed in. %They_wildman% launches a fist and absolutely obliterates the bees. Honeycombs stickily flail around %their_wildman% wrist as though %their_wildman% hairy arm were an impromptu maypole. The Wildman casually walks back down the sand dune. As %they_wildman% nears, you see bees crawling all over %their_wildman% face and stinging away like the pissed off savages that they are, but %they_wildman% doesn\'t seem to even sense their presence. %They_wildman% holds out the crunchy remains of %their_wildman% honeyed demolition as though %they_wildman% held the heart of a ferocious beast.}";
