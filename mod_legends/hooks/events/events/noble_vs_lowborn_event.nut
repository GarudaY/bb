It is a simple thing with a wooden handle and jagged, unnaturally serrated edges. The %noble_nobleman% pulls %their_nobleman% blade in return, brandishing a metal that curves with the care of a blacksmith\'s mastery. Two golden snakes curl up the handle to bite the pommel. Its wielder grins, saying the riff-raff should learn their place. The lowborn grins like a %person_lowborn% who has had no practice doing it.\n\nSurprisingly, both then chuck the daggers into the stumps upon which they sat and close rank with fists raised, the most equal of fighting grounds. In the ensuing battle the spit is immediately knocked aside and flames fan upward, raining wild embers and the felled food is now flavored with ash and soot.\n\nSeeing their meal ruined, the rest of the company finally puts an end to the combat, pulling the two apart. They threaten and spit at one another, but after a few minutes everything settles down.";
