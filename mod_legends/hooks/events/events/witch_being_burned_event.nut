Three of its citizens are in the town center being burned alive. The fires grow beneath them until the flames come licking their feet, then crawling up their legs, drawing them to cry out for mercy to which the crowds responds by throwing rocks.\n\nYou about draw your sword to end this injustice when %witchhunter_short% the witchhunter stays your hand. %They_witchhunter% shakes %their_witchhunter% head and points at the burnings. Soon enough, the begging stops and all three victims open their mouths, issuing forth a rumbling that silences the crowd and even the crackle of fire beneath them. They speak in a guttural, uniform voice.%SPEECH_ON%Ye who watches us perish, shall perish themselves!%SPEECH_OFF%The bodies suddenly slump forward as though instantly made dead and the cooking of their flesh resumes with a steady popping.
