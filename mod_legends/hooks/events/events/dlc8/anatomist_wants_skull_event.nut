Passing peasants pause and profess faith to it. As you get closer, you realize the skull itself is extraordinary: a long, thick forehead juts out from the top, its brow quite dominant and ridged, and the jaw of it, still intact, carries enormous and sharp teeth, most of which are in a state of disorder, as if in any ordinary head closing such a mouth would be a danger to itself. What it very well may be is a Nachzehrer\'s skull. Naturally, with this strange skeletal sight before you, you hope to turn the company away before-%SPEECH_ON%We should take that for studying.%SPEECH_OFF%Sighing, you turn to see %anatomist% standing there, ogling the skull. You correct %them_anatomist%, saying instead that what %they_anatomist% really means is %they_anatomist% intends to steal it.

You\'re not going to be responsible for the mayhem that goes down if %they_anatomist% is caught so you leave %them_anatomist% to it, returning instead to count inventory while keeping your ears perked for sounds of religion wrecking chaos. A few moments later, %anatomist% returns, a fat skull cradled under an arm and a bit of sweat on %their_anatomist% brow.%SPEECH_ON%It\'s a Nachzehrer\'s skull and should be of great value to our studies.%SPEECH_OFF%Curious, you ask %them_anatomist% how it was that %they_anatomist% managed to get the skull in the first place. %anatomist% raises an eyebrow.%SPEECH_ON%You weren\'t watching?
