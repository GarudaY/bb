Though I suppose one could be easily mistaken for the other.%SPEECH_OFF%Chuckling, %they_disowned% offers a bit of %their_disowned% drink, which you take. Settling down beside %them_disowned%, you ask what it is %they_disowned% is \'thinking\' about. The disowned noble%person_disowned% shrugs again.%SPEECH_ON%Ahh, nothing really. Just thinking about home. I\'m a long ways away from it now, and the last I remember of it isn\'t exactly the best, yet I still find myself wishing to be there now and again. Homesick for a land that thinks me a sort of noble sickness, go figure.%SPEECH_OFF%You hand %them_disowned% back to %their_disowned% drink as %they_disowned% probably needs it more than you.

But it\'s only good for a time. You look at the past, you acknowledge it, and then you move on. You have to be sure to only visit the past, not dwell in it. Everyone here has a past, %disowned%, and in that respect you will never be alone.%SPEECH_OFF%The disowned noble%person_disowned% stares at the ground for a time. %They_disowned% slowly starts to nod.%SPEECH_ON%Yeah, yeah, that\'s right. I guess a part of me was worried that I was genuinely wanting to return there. I was picturing it with the hearth alight, smoke out of the chimney, soft candlelight beyond the windows, and my family there awaiting me. I was ignoring the locked door, the guard dogs squatting outside, and those I love telling me to never come back lest it\'s in a box to bury far beneath the earth. I wasn\'t thinking of my past so much as dreaming of it, and I think you\'ve helped me realize that, captain. Thank you. I know that, one day, I shan\'t have to dream about the %companyname%, but instead remember it clearly and fondly.%SPEECH_OFF%";
