The landscape has changed significantly, but some details remain in the distance.

As you reminisce, a legionary pulls themselves from a collapsed siege tower, making great effort to not damage their armour in the process — they fall into line with %companyname%. | Near the fortifications, a great battle has raged some time ago. Under the thick clumps of soil and wreathes of grass you can hear the bones cracking of ages past. In the distance, you see a lone legionary, rising and pulling a sword lodged between their ribcage.
