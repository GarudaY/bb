The northern %person_monk% is studying the dervish\'s posture and expression as though it was one of %them_monk% many holy tomes, scribbling mental notes whilst trying to emulate %their_dervish% peer\'s technique. %SPEECH_ON%I don\'t know how %they_dervish% does it, captain.%SPEECH_OFF% %monk% whispers. %SPEECH_ON%I\'ve been watching this ritual of theirs for a while now, and it\'s completely unlike anything from my monastery\'s archives.%SPEECH_OFF% %monk% squirms uncomfortably, as though they\'re sat on an ant hill or thorn bush. Across from %them_monk%, the statue of a %person_dervish% sat stoic yet firm, eyes and ears gently sealed against the increasing disturbance across from %them_monk%, while a fist sized spider creeps its way up %them_dervish% leg.\n\nWith a grimace, %monk% stumbles to %their_monk% feet and backs away, dusting their legs down of loose earth and twigs, but no spindly stowaways, much to their apparent relief. %They_monk% approaches you, clearly impressed by the dervish\'s resolve. %SPEECH_ON%Every day, captain. Every day %they_dervish% does this, for hours at a time. I\'ve seen %them_dervish% do it in rain and snow, in blistering heat and, uh, crippling cold. If %they_dervish% can withstand such torments in the name of %them_dervish% Gilder, then surely I can suffer what the Gods have deigned necessary for me to endure.%SPEECH_OFF%You nod, though suspect there\'s something much more personal at play you could never truly understand. With a faint smile and hopeful strut, %they_monk% returns to camp, their day a little brighter.\n\nAs you glance back at the dervish deep in trance, the spider clambers across his face, then crawls out of view onto %them_dervish% back.}",
