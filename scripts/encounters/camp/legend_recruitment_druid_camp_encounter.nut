Drawing your sword, you approach the mysterious figure. %SPEECH_ON%I started this?! How dare you, you... you-%SPEECH_OFF% The witch collapses and begins to heave %their_Druid% stomach onto the ground. Having finished, %they_Druid% rise into a kneeling position and stare at the flames. %SPEECH_ON%I am a druid. For generations, we have protected this sacred wood. Until me. A band of raiders were passing through, trying to hide from pursuers, and demanded I conceal them. When I refused, they torched my cabin. One thing led to another...%SPEECH_OFF% %they_Druid%give a weak gesture towards the conflagration before you. %SPEECH_ON%I have failed the cause of centuries. All but a trickle of my magic has deserted me, the space it once resided now nigh consumed by irrational, all-consuming hate. I am nothing now. I have a request, warrior with steel. Kill me. Let me be one with the forest I have so grossly failed, one final time.%SPEECH_OFF% You shake your head slowly. This is a broken soul before you. Frankly, you\'re not sure if %they_Druid% won\'t just kill themselves right here and now. Perhaps a druid could be useful to a mercenary company?
