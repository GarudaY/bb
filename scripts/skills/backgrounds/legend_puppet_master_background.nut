His natural gifts were never put to much use however. | %name% never had much disipline as a child, they would frequently cause mischief around their father\'s' estate. They discovered their dark gifts on accident while poking a living corpse trapped in the arches of the watermill, and the rest just fell into place. | %name% never understood why everyone was running around and so angry all the time. To them life is about relaxation and enjoying things, even if that involves having a small army of shuffling corpses to bring you drinks and clear the weeds from the herb garden. | %name% discovered their gifts early into their development. At first it was an accident involving a stray dog, but that experience quickly grew into an art form for %name% until they were exiled for their interests. | %name% was a child without a purpose. Born into nobility they spent their days as a child crushing ants and poking dead animals in the courtyard.
